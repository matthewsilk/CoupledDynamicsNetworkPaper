# CoupledDynamicsNetworkPaper
R code for the paper "Improving pandemic mitigation policies across communities through coupled dynamics of risk perception and infection"

R code to conduct the simulations and analyse the results of the paper.

The four csvs contain parameter sets used to run the simulations and in the analysis.
The nine .RDS files contain the objects used to create the multiplex networks used in the simulations
FunctionsForHealthPaper.R is the functions used for the network modelling
ScriptForHealthPaper2.R runs the simulations
NetworksPaper1AnalysisCode_tidy.R analyses the results to produce the figures and tables in the manuscript and supplementary
